## Chrome Extension: Open Data detector

This Chrome Extension detects if there are any "open data" web services on a page and shows you the links in a pop-over window.

Currently supported open data services include

- ArcGIS services

You are welcome to add more!

## Install

Currently this is only available to install in Developer mode.

1. Clone or download this repository to your computer
2. Open Google Chrome.
3. Go to `chrome://extensions`.
4. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
5. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the `chrome-opendata-detector` folder.

The extension should now be installed in your browser. An icon will appear next to the address bar. When you click on the icon, the popover window should display a list of detected "Open Data" URLs in the network traffic.

To start, visit my favorite open dataset, [DC Trees](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::urban-forestry-street-trees).
